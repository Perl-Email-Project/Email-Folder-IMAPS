NAME
    Email::Folder::IMAP - Email::Folder Access to IMAP over SSL Folders

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::Folder;
  
      my $folder = Email::Folder->new('imaps://example.com'); # read INBOX
  
      print $_->header('Subject') for $folder->messages;

DESCRIPTION
    This software adds IMAPS functionality to Email::Folder. Its interface
    is identical to the other Email::Folder::Reader subclasses.

  Parameters
    "username" and "password" parameters may be sent to "new()". If used,
    they override any user info passed in the connection URI.

  Folder Specification
    Folders are specified using a simplified form of the IMAP URL Scheme
    detailed in RFC 2192. Not all of that specification applies. Here are a
    few examples.

    Selecting the INBOX.

      https://foo.com

    Selecting the INBOX using URI based authentication. Remember that the
    "username" and "password" parameters passed to "new()" will override
    anything set in the URI.

      https://user:pass@foo.com

    Selecting the p5p list.
